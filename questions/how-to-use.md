Which of the following is right about this tool?

# truth
- [ ] This is primarily a documentation tool.
- [ ] This is primarily a visualization tool.

This tool creates static html + js pages parsed from markdown and host them using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Only people with access to the repo (and therefore its github pages) can access them. This will be a braincorp org repo so no one outside braincorp will be able access this info

- [x] I write questions and their true answers in markdown which gets turned into a quiz.
- [ ] I can write absolutely anything and it gets turned into a quiz.

You can write questions in markdown but you need to follow the minimal structure
```
# prompt

# options
- [ ] give atleast
- [ ] two options

# hint

# explaination
```
or else CI/CD will ask you to change it.

- [ ] I cannot use images since this is markdown.

This is markdown so you can use images, unicode üòÄ, tables, with github even videos.

- [x] I can answer questions in a browser.
- [x] I can answer questions in a mobile.

Nope! You can [learn common mark in under 60 seconds here](https://commonmark.org/).

You donot need to read html ever, all questions are stored as markdown which you can read in github itself. For ex

You are not supposed to know anything here, just guess what you think the tool is about and check.

Don't feel bad if you get an incorrect answer. That's learning üòÑüëè!
