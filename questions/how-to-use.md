This is markdown so you can use images, unicode üòÄ, tables, with github even videos.

You can answer questions in any device that has a browser.

This tool creates static html + js pages parsed from markdown and host them using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Only people with access to the repo (and therefore its github pages) can access them. This will be a braincorp org repo so no one outside braincorp will be able access this info

Nope! You can [learn common mark in under 60 seconds here](https://commonmark.org/).

You donot need to read html ever, all questions are stored as markdown which you can read in github itself.
