[^privacy]: There are some privacy concerns. It’s easy enough to keep a shopper’s riding data private from the merchant, but to enforce discount limits, the merchant will have to send sales totals to the server, giving the transit agency the ability to collect substantial information about the shopping habits of its riders. There’s no easy way around this, except to put in place a firewall between the agency and the terminal.
